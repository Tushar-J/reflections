1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans. Initializing a repository means creating a repository to track all files in that directory. It maintains status of each additions and deletions to contents of files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans. Stating area contains those files which are added to git but not committed. It allows us to add individual files for commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Ans. We can add modified files to staging area before they are actually committed.
